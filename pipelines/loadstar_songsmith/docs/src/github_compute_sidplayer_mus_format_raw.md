# Enhanced SID Player .MUS File Format
## Binary Format
.MUS Files are PRG Files.  
All 2 byte values are in Lo/Hi order.
| Bytes | Description | Notes |
| :--: | -- | -- | 
| 0-1 | Load Address | Ignored by SID Editors and Players<br/>SID Editors and Players will load or save the song into their own specific address. |
| 2-3 | Voice 1 Data Size | Count of bytes |
| 4-5 | Voice 2 Data Size | Count of bytes |
| 6-7 | Voice 3 Data Size | Count of bytes |
|  | Voice 1 Data | Always ends in HLT ($01 $4F) |
|  | Voice 2 Data | Always ends in HLT ($01 $4F) |
|  | Voice 3 Data | Always ends in HLT ($01 $4F) |
|  | Song Description | NULL Terminated text describing the song and other misc. data |

## Voice Data Format
Voice data is a stream of command/option pairs represented by 2 bytes of data.  
The voice data will always end with a HLT Halt Command.
The first byte is called the command byte and the second byte is called the option byte leading the reader to believe that the voice data format is simply an 8 bit value referencing a command followed by an 8 bit value.
In reality the bits for the command and data are intermixed across both bytes.
For example, the POR (Portamento) command is just 2 bits to identify the command and 14 bits of data (Value from 0-16383) taken from both the command and option bytes.
## Note Command  
The command is a note when the command byte contains a 0 in bits 0 and 1.  
The command byte contains the duration of the note.  
The option byte contains the accidental, octave and note to be played.  
Not all note durations are available in all tempos.  See tempo chart below.  
### Note Duration Byte (Command Byte)
| Bit(s) | Description | Values |
| :--: | -- | -- |
| 0-1 |  | Always 00 |
| 2-4 | Duration | 010 Whole <br/> 011 Half <br/>100 Quarter <br/>101 Eighth <br/>110 16th <br/> 111 32nd <br/> 000 64th|
| 5 |  Dotted | 0=No 1=Yes |
| 6 |  Tie | 0=No 1=Yes |
| 7 |  Double Dotted | 0=No 1=Yes |

### Note Byte (Option Byte)
| Bit(s) | Description | Values |
| :--: | -- | -- |
| 0-2 | Note to Play | Rest=000 C=001 d=010 e=011 f=100 g=101 a=110 b=111  |
| 3-5 | Octave | Values 0-7.<br/>Stored EORed with 11111111 |
| 6-7 |  Accidental | 10 Normal <br/>01 Sharp <br/>11 FLAT   |

## Command Reference
The commands are grouped together as they appear in the SID Editor.  
0 and 1 are used for pattern matching the command to a routine that processes it.  
bbbbbb shows that the bits that are used as a value.  B is used here to show that the routine is using the entire option byte.  
aaaa shows the bits that are used as a value.  A is used when the routine has the value in the accumulator after LSRing the other bits off in the process of routing the command to the routine.  
c signifies that the bit will end up in the carry flag when the routine is run.  
n signifies bits that are not used at all by the routine.
