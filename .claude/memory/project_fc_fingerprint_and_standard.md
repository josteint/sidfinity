## FC player-version fingerprinting — `tools/fc_fingerprint.py`
Relocation-invariant FC player identification. Traces reachable code from
init+play (reuses `seed_disassembly.trace`), takes the OPCODE skeleton
(relocation changes operands, not opcodes → reloc-invariant), clusters by exact
SHA1 + opcode-4-gram Jaccard. Validated: same engine relocated → 0.94-1.0;
different FC versions → ≤0.64 (Adrenalin engine A vs Cyb II vs Hawkeye).
Run: `PYTHONPATH=tools/py65_lib:tools:src python3 tools/fc_fingerprint.py --corpus`.
NB: the corpus query must use `LIKE '%FutureComposer%'` — `LIKE '%MoN%'` is
case-insensitive and sweeps in SoundMONitor.

## Corpus result (the big finding)
4024 HVSC FutureComposer SIDs → 901 distinct skeletons, 109 families.
**ONE dominant family = 3673/4024 ≈ 91%** (the vanilla FC editor player).
Migrate that ONE player → covers ~91% of the FC catalogue. The migrated
canaries so far (Cyb II, Hawkeye) and Adrenalin's engine A are LARGER
demoscene-CUSTOM variants (outliers, 0.32-0.64 to each other) — i.e. we
migrated the hard custom players first and never the easy vanilla one.

## Adrenalin verdict (fingerprint-confirmed)
Adrenalin's 4 subs span 3 FC variants; all are customized OUTLIERS (engine A
best corpus match 0.78, sub1 0.04). The fingerprint gives NO layout shortcut
for it — it stays manual. Sub 1 IS FC (full disasm: `sub1_disassembly.s`),
just a slim variant at its own addresses. Engine A ≈ Hawkeye (0.64) is its
closest reference. Adrenalin is low catalogue value (4 SIDs) vs the vanilla
player (3673); deprioritized in favour of the standard-player migration.

## Standard ("vanilla") FC player migration — `pipelines/future_composer/standard/`
Representative: `Carter/Jarre_2.sid` (load $1800). `disassembly.s` annotated
with the full data-address map: freq lo/hi $1D64/$1DC4 (96-entry canonical
table), instr records $2188 (8B, id<<3), pattern_ptr $1EA7 (2B interleaved),
seq/orderlist ptrs $1EA1(lo)/$1EA4(hi) (= flat_seq_table 6B record @ $1EA1),
speed $211D, d4point $211E. `config.py` (FC_STANDARD) drives the EXTRACT, which
WORKS (sane FCSong: 96 freq, 10 instr, 5 patterns, 3 seqs).

**NEXT STEP (where it stopped 2026-06-09):** first build+trichotomy-verify
diverges on the PLAY stream (`shift=None`, rebuild ~10% more writes). Init
diff is trichotomy-handled (orig ascending clear vs composer generic init).
Root cause of the play divergence: the instruments use fx1/fx2/fx3 (non-zero)
but the aux effect-program tables (arp/pulse/filter/drum/vibrato) are still at
0 in the config — MAP THOSE ADDRESSES from disassembly.s next, then iterate
write-log divergence. Then add relocation handling (family members load at
$1800/$4800/... → derive addrs from load) so ONE config covers all 3673.
Verdict = `verify_featuredriven` (trichotomy + audio✓).
