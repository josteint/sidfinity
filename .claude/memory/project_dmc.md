## DMC — the focus engine after FC standard went uready (2026-06-12)

Largest HVSC family: 10,676 SIDs (`engine LIKE 'DMC%'` in hvsc84.db).
Player by Brian/Graffity, never source-released. All research in
`pipelines/dmc/docs/` (README.md is the index; provenance_log.md per wave).

## Census (tools/engine_fingerprint.py — renamed/generalized from fc_fingerprint)
`pipelines/dmc/docs/fingerprint_census.md`. 688 exact skeletons → 134
families. **Family 1 = V4 canonical, 5401 (50.6%)** — 0.973 vs the V4
player binary carved from DMC 4 Editor 2025
(`docs/dmc4_player_embedded_1000.bin`). Family 2 = V4-derived variant,
2889 (0.732 to V4, identity TBD — diff later; much may carry over).
Families 3+4+5 = V5 line (2181). V6 = 15 (different player, skip).
Raw data: `tmp/dmc_fingerprint.jsonl` + `tmp/dmc_families.json`
(regen: `tmp/dmc_census.py`). NB the canary-picker DMC candidates are
all V5-line/tail — NOT family 1 (same trap as FC's custom-outliers).

## V4 disassembly — DONE, fully annotated
`pipelines/dmc/v4/disassembly.s` — representative
`MUSICIANS/A/Amadeus_Slash_Design/Geometrical_Zaks.sid` (family-1
dominant exact hash = 3002 members, 3 subtunes, load/init $1000 play $1003).
Header carries: memory map, full variable map, sector/track byte dispatch,
instrument record, filter def, wave table semantics, play flow + write order.

**KEY EXTRACTION FINDING: the editor's packer PATCHES the player's absolute
operands per song.** Fixed: code skeleton, freq tables ($1647/$16A7),
instruments ($18F0), per-note vib depth table ($1888, OVERLAPS code bytes
$1888-$188D for notes 0-5). Patched (read by dataflow at operand sites
$1227/$159C/$15B9/$1296/$180E/$1103/$1108): wavectrl, wavefreq, filterdef,
tunetab, sector ptr lo/hi. Region sizes = address deltas. Some family-1
members have wrapper inits/shifted code (On_My_Way_to_X, Retro_Tech) →
factory must probe, FC-style.

## Engine model essentials (write-log-relevant)
- Duration-based (NOT tick-synced voices); tick = speed-counter reload;
  time = (speed+1) × duration frames.
- Note lifecycle: fetch frame writes ONLY $08→ctrl + $0F→AD+SR (hard
  restart); frame 2 = real AD/SR + pulse/filter/vib init + wave step +
  freq/PW/ctrl; gate on 3 frames min ($1786 guard), then non-holding
  ($10 clear) instruments get gate-mask $FE → tail rides SID release.
  Holding: gate off at duration ctr == 1 (+ AD/SR=$00, sub_17EC).
- Steady-state writes per voice per frame: freq lo,hi, PW lo,hi, ctrl;
  then global $D416 (cutoff), $D417 (res|route). $D418 ONLY at init and
  at filter note-init (mode|vol) — sparse!
- Sector dispatch: $F0-$FF VOL (sustain override), $7C soft-start toggle,
  $7E rest, $7D SWITCH (gate-mask bit0 toggle), $C0-$DF glide/slide
  (bit4=mode), $80-$BF duration (&$3F), $60-$7B instrument (&$1F),
  $00-$5F note, $7F sector end (peeked post-event). Track: $00-$7F
  sector#, $80-$9F/-$A0-$BF transpose ∓0-31 (then next byte = sector),
  $FE voice end (state freewheels!), $FF loop.
- Instrument 11B: AD, SR, PWbounds/init, PW speed nibbles ×3 (6 phases,
  saturate at 5), PWstep-base|filterdef#, vibdelay|width, vibramp/slide
  speed, wave start, FX flags ($01 drum abs-freq, $02/$04 no filt/pulse
  reset, $08 no gate-off, $10 holding, $20 filter, $40 half-rate
  per-note slide w/ GLOBAL parity $1019, $80 cymbal $FFFF+$81).
- Vibrato: triangle, per-note depth ($1888 table), width DOUBLES per
  half-cycle until ramp ctr == byte8; dead-code ADC/BIT quirk at $1589.
- Wave: 2 parallel arrays (ctrl, freq-offset); ctrl >= $90 jumps back
  (val-$90); melodic freq byte REBASES the note (arp); drum = abs hi.
- Filter: single owner per frame ($1720 claim, first voice in X order);
  16B defs: res|mode, cutoff, repeat, stop, 6×(size), 6×(duration).
- Init does NOT clear $1018 ($D417 route shadow) — file-image leftover
  leaks into $D417 until instruments set it (init.sid priming candidate).
- Entries: init/play/+$06 all-off/+$09 sfx (A=note Y=instr X=voice,
  no transpose)/+$1D tune-select.
- ZP $F8/$F9 only.

## NEXT (migration loop)
1. `pipelines/dmc/v4/config.py` + extract (dataflow operand reader →
   instruments/wave/filter/tracks/sectors → USF; check
   docs/usf_representation_principle.md FIRST per the tripwire).
2. Composer emitters for the DMC write model (new family alongside
   hubbard/companion/FC — composer_asm vs composer.py split TBD).
3. Write-log-first iteration on Geometrical_Zaks (verify_featuredriven-
   style verdict; find_first_divergence localizer).
4. Then: relocation/factory rollout over family 1 (probe patched
   operands); family 2 diff; V5 line later (sector encoding still
   needs RE — see docs/dmc_v5_format_notes.md).
